It leverages the RAWG Video Games Database API for detailed game information. This platform allows users to search for games, view details, add favorite games to their personal library, rate them, and maintain a personalized wishlist.

## Installation
To use the application, follow these steps:

- Step 1: **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodexX.git
    ```
- Step 2: **Install dependencies**:
   - For the server:
     ```bash
     cd CodexX/server
     npm install
     ```
   - For the client:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```
- Step 3: **Configure environment variables**:
   - Create `.env` files in both `/server` and `/client` directories.
   - In `/server/.env`, set up your database and JWT secret keys:
     ```plaintext
     PORT=3001
     JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
     DB_USER=your_db_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     DB_NAME=videogame_db
     REQUEST_URL=https://api.rawg.io/api/
     API_KEY=your_rawg_api_key
     ```
- Step 4: **Run the database setup**:
   - Start PostgreSQL and run the schema setup located in `server/db/schema.sql`.
   - (Optional) Seed the database with sample users and games using the seed scripts in `server/src/seeds`.
- Step 5: **Start the development servers**:
   - For the server:
     ```bash
     npm run start:dev
     ```
   - For the client:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm run dev
     ```
